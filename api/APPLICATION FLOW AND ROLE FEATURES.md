Key Differentiators Between Roles
Admin vs. Editor:
Admins can delete critical data; Editors cannot
Admins manage users; Editors manage content
Admins have system-wide access; Editors have team/department scope
Editor vs. Viewer:
Editors can create content; Viewers consume content
Editors can import data; Viewers can only export
Editors can create shared dashboards; Viewers can only personalize their view
This role structure aligns with the project objectives by implementing proper role-based access control while adding the Editor role mentioned in the "Future Enhancements" section. It creates a clear hierarchy of responsibilities and permissions that supports organizational needs from executive oversight to team management to individual contributors.
